Windows Thread Injection and Manipulation
This project demonstrates a method of injecting and executing custom code in a thread within a Windows process using Rust. The technique involves creating a trampoline buffer to jump to a specified target address and manipulating thread contexts for execution redirection.

Features
Thread context manipulation using WinAPI.
Injection of custom trampoline code into a target process.
Execution redirection to custom code within a target thread.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following requirements:

Rust programming environment.
Windows development environment with appropriate SDKs for WinAPI.
Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/windows-thread-injection.git
```
Navigate into the project directory:

```
cd windows-thread-injection
```
Compile the project with:
```
cargo build --release
```
Usage
The main functionality is contained within the main.rs file. Adjust the target address and the path to the target DLL according to your needs. The project demonstrates how to:

Allocate memory within a target process for the trampoline code.
Write the trampoline code into the allocated memory.
Modify the target thread's context to redirect execution to the injected code.
Note: This project is for educational purposes only. Misuse of this code can affect system stability and security. Always ensure you have permission to manipulate processes and threads on your target system.
