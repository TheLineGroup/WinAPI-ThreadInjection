Windows Thread Injection and Manipulation (Experimental)

This experimental project showcases an advanced method for injecting and executing custom code within a thread of a Windows process using Rust. It demonstrates a sophisticated technique that involves crafting a trampoline buffer to seamlessly jump to a specified target address while manipulating thread contexts to redirect execution flow.

Key Features

Thread Context Manipulation: Utilizes WinAPI to manipulate thread contexts, enabling the precise control needed for code injection.
Custom Trampoline Injection: Dynamically generates and injects trampoline code into a target process, facilitating execution redirection to user-specified code.
Execution Redirection: Alters the execution flow within a target thread, directing it towards custom injected code, showcasing the potential for advanced process manipulation.

Prerequisites

Before diving into this experimental endeavor, ensure you meet the following requirements:

A Rust programming environment setup on your machine.

A Windows development environment equipped with the necessary SDKs for WinAPI usage.

Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local environment:

```
git clone https://github.com/thelinegroup/windows-thread-injection.git
```

Change directory into the project folder:

```
cd windows-thread-injection
```

Compile the project using Cargo:

```
cargo build --release
````

Usage Guide

The core functionality of this project resides within the main.rs file. You'll need to adjust the target address and path to your target DLL as per your requirements. The provided example demonstrates how to:

Allocate memory within a target process specifically for the trampoline code.
Inject the crafted trampoline code into the allocated memory space.
Modify the context of a target thread to redirect its execution to the injected code.
Note: This project is designed for experimental and educational purposes only. Exercise caution and ensure you have explicit permission to manipulate processes and threads on any target system.
